BeerBo Data Analyst Challenge â€“ Analysis Summary

This project combines and analyzes manufacturing performance data across three datasets:
- ProductionMetric.csv
- Quality.csv
- DeviceProperty.csv

Key Findings:
- Line 4 had the highest reject rate (2.54%) but also the best output rate.
- Unplanned downtime accounted for nearly 76% of total downtime.
- Most frequent downtime reason: 'Security Alarm'
- Rejects were most commonly due to 'Detected by Max WIP' and 'Cosmetic Defect'.
- Type-based reject analysis showed Smart-Logistics machines had the highest reject rate.

SQL Server and Python were used for analysis and statistical summarization.

Generated visualizations:
- Bar charts (reject rate, good/hour, top downtime reasons)
- Box plots (cycle time variation)
- Scatter plots (efficiency vs reject rate)
